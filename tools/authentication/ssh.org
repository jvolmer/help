* Generate a key
#+begin_src shell
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<email>"
#+end_src
For legacy systems you can use the rsa algorithm.

* ssh-agent
Keeps track of the user's identity keys and their passphrases. After adding an identity, ssh-agent asks for the identity's passphrase and stores it in memory. When the passphrase is needed, ssh-agent will provided it.

Start it (should already be running on Linux)
#+begin_src shell
  eval `ssh-agent`
#+end_src

Do stuff
#+begin_src shell
  ssh-add
#+end_src
