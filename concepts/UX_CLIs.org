Up/down: history
Tab: Completion

* Discoverability
- Autocompletion as I type: Give options (popup menu) (PGCLI)
- Show command completion I used most recently, go to ones before with arrow keys (Fish Shell)

-> Be forthcoming and don't hide special keys

* User Focus
- bad: e.g. MySQL: Tab completion only for CAPSLOCK and too many options for tab completion for table name
- Give possible options for Tab completion (only ones that are applicable, but also keep in mind stuff (e.g. lower caps = large caps), b, perhaps show helpful stuff for a specific argument, e.g. how to use a function (bpython)
  
-> User comes first, Implementation later

* Configurability is evil
Only configure absolutely necesary options
Otherwise: Should give good defaults

-> Subjective options only (e.g. color scheme)

* Checklist
** Persistent History
** History search (Control-R or show last command in grey which start with what you already showed - FishShell)
** Emacs Keybindings (Ctrl-a, Ctrl-e, Ctrl-b, -f)
** Auto-Completion
** Minimal Config
** Syntax Coloring
