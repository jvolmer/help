* C++ Questions
** Better way to need to implement == and >> for running tests
Rust uses traits for that and you can use their default implementation (e.g. Debug and PartialEq)
** Difference between template<class T> and template<typename T>
** Why not use a constexpr constructor everywhere possible
** std::variant at compilation time: subtypes?
** self type (e.g. as return type for static member function instead of constructor)
