* cmake for projects
https://github.com/dr-kino/BraveCoverage/blob/master/test/CMakeLists.txt

** There are two types of targets, executables and libraries

** Scope
Sequence of commands in one file does not matter
*** Directory scope
Defined stuff affects targets in current directory and all subdirectories
=include_directories(<path>)=
*** Target scope
specified via PRIVATE, PUBLIC, INTERFACE (there is only private and interface: private properties are used internally to build the target (build requirements), interface properties are used externally by users of the target (usage requirements))
public properties are defined in both private and interace scopes

** How to call functions

** Projectstructure

** Configure time vs Build time (?)

** Usage

From the root (not build dir)
#+begin_src shell
  # generate build system
  cmake -S . -B build # -S <path-to-source> -B <path-to-build> [will be created if not exists]
  # setup build system
  cmake --build build # equivalent to make in build dir
  # with variables: -D<var>=<value>
  
  # install
  cmake --install build # equivalent to make install in build dir
                        # for CMake < 3.15 : cmake --build build --target install
  
  # build
  cmake --build build --target <TARGET> # equivalent to make <TARGET>
#+end_src

** Properties
Use with ~cmake <source-dir> -D<property>~

| CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 | generate compile_commands.json (needed for lsp) |
| CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=On       | show commands when building                     |
|                                 | (use VERBOSE=1) for a single make               |
