SPI: Serial Peripheral Interface for one master and multiple slave dublex communication

Typically there are three lines common to all the devices:

MISO (Master In Slave Out) - The Slave line for sending data to the master,
MOSI (Master Out Slave In) - The Master line for sending data to the peripherals,
SCK (Serial Clock) - The clock pulses which synchronize data transmission generated by the master
and one line specific for every device:

SS/CS (Slave/Chip Select) - the pin on each device that the master can use to enable and disable specific devices.
When a device's Slave Select pin is low, it communicates with the master. When it's high, it ignores the master. This allows you to have multiple SPI devices sharing the same MISO, MOSI, and CLK lines
